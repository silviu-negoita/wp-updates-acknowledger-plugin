## wordpress-updates-acknowledger

Manage the article viewers per each version via a wordpress widget. Keep in mind that this plugin is meant to be used as internal company tool because it has security issues.

This plugin contains :
	* side bar widget to manage viewers per article
	* overview page for all articles and users
	
To use the overview page, just add custom field on any post : wpua_updates_acknowledger_overview_page = on. This will rewrite any page content with our updated acknowledger overview content.
